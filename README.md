## Basic Winsock Usage


</div>

### Description

This code is probably not the best for learning from, however I decided to post it in the hope that maybe it could help someone figure out the extreme basics of using the winsock control. Basicly, I wrote this to play a prank on a friend, you know just scare him a bit, but after using it I decided to go ahead and submit it, hoping maybe it would help someone out with winsock. I will say right now I don't highly expect it to be of to much use, but I hope it is. If you find you can't learn anything from it, or don't understand it, don't critisize automaticly, email me at steve81@mediaone.net and I will happily help you in any way possible. I just hope it is of some use to some people, but don't use it for anything bad, just try to learn from it. Thanks.
